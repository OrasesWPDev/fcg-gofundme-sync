<objective>
Create template campaign in Classy sandbox that will serve as the duplication source for all fund campaigns.

Purpose: The plugin cannot create campaigns directly (Classy API limitation) - it must duplicate an existing template. This template needs to exist before any automation can work.

Output: A campaign ID that the user can configure in plugin settings (Plan 02).

Key constraints:
- POST /organizations/{org_id}/campaigns returns 403 (not a public endpoint)
- Must use duplicateCampaign endpoint to create campaigns from template
- Template campaign must be Studio type (not legacy Classy Mode)

  <name>Task 1: Create Template Campaign in Classy Sandbox</name>

  <why>
  Classy API does not allow direct campaign creation - only duplication. A template campaign must exist in Classy before the plugin can create campaigns for WordPress funds.
  </why>

  <instructions>
  1. Log into Classy sandbox dashboard (https://sandbox.classy.org)
  2. Navigate to Campaigns section
  3. Create a new campaign:
     - Name: "FCG Template Campaign" (or similar - this is internal reference only)
     - Type: Must be **Studio** campaign (not legacy Classy Mode)
     - Goal: Set a default goal (e.g., $1,000) - this will be overridden per-fund
     - Set up desired default branding, description, and settings
  4. Publish the campaign (it needs to be active to be duplicated)
  5. Note the campaign ID from the URL (e.g., https://sandbox.classy.org/admin/campaigns/12345)

  **Important:** The template campaign defines the default:
  - Branding (logo, colors, hero image)
  - Page layout and sections
  - Default text/description (can be overridden per-fund)
  - Settings (donation options, fees handling, etc.)

  These defaults will be inherited by all duplicated campaigns.
  </instructions>

  <deliver>
  Share the campaign ID (numeric value from URL).
  Example: If URL is https://sandbox.classy.org/admin/campaigns/12345, the ID is 12345
  </deliver>

  <resume-signal>Provide the template campaign ID (e.g., "12345")</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- User has provided a numeric campaign ID
- Campaign exists in Classy sandbox (will be validated in Plan 02)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Template campaign created in Classy sandbox with Studio type
- Campaign ID known and ready to configure in plugin settings
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-configuration/01-01-SUMMARY.md`

Include in summary:
- Template campaign ID
- Campaign name and type
- Any notable default settings chosen
</output>
