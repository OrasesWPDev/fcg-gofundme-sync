# Frederick County Gives - Fund Page Update Summary

**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Prepared for:** Frederick County Community Foundation

## What's Changing

We've updated how donors access the donation form when browsing funds on your website.

### Before
When a donor clicked on a fund from the "All Funds" listing page:
- A popup window appeared showing the fund details
- The donation form loaded inside that popup
- Donors could give without leaving the listing page

### After
When a donor clicks on a fund from the "All Funds" listing page:
- They go directly to the fund's dedicated page
- The donation form loads on that page
- Donors complete their gift on the fund's page

**The "Learn More" link has been renamed to "Give Now"** to make it clear this is the path to donate.

## Why This Change Was Necessary

The new Classy donation system (replacing Acceptiva) uses modern technology that doesn't work well inside popup windows. When we tested donations through the popup:

- The initial donation form would appear correctly
- But when donors clicked "Donate" to enter payment information, the payment screen wouldn't open
- This would have prevented donors from completing their gifts

Rather than show donors a broken experience, we've updated the site so clicking on a fund takes them directly to that fund's page where everything works smoothly.

## What Donors Will Experience

### Browsing Funds
| Element | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Fund name | Opens popup | Goes to fund page |
| "Learn More" link | Goes to fund page | Renamed to **"Give Now"**, goes to fund page |
| "Give Now" button | Opens popup | Removed (redundant) |

### Making a Donation
The donation experience on individual fund pages is unchanged and fully functional:
1. Donor visits fund page
2. Selects donation amount
3. Clicks "Donate"
4. Enters payment information
5. Completes donation

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reliable donations** - Every donation attempt will work correctly
2. **Simpler navigation** - One clear path to donate
3. **Better for sharing** - Donors can bookmark or share fund page URLs
4. **Mobile friendly** - Fund pages work better on phones than popups

---

## What This Doesn't Affect

- Individual fund pages - No changes, work exactly as before
- Donation processing - All donations go through Classy as planned
- Fund information - All details still visible on fund pages
- Search functionality - Still works the same way

---

## Timeline

- **Currently:** Changes are live on the staging/test site
- **Production:** Will be deployed when you're ready to go live with Classy
